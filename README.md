# aurelia-semantic-ui

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ged/aurelia-semantic-ui](https://badges.gitter.im/ged/aurelia-semantic-ui.svg)](https://gitter.im/ged/aurelia-semantic-ui?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This plugin is for the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform. It contains custom attributes for some of the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) widgets.

It isn't really even alpha quality right now, as I'm still figuring out how half of this stuff works, so don't depend on anything quite yet.

The major "to do" list:

* TESTING. I have done very little, as I wasn't even sure this would be useful or implemented in a way that made sense. Now that I've used it in anger, though, I need get tests implemented ASAP.
* Documentation via [the demo app](http://ged.github.io/aurelia-semantic-ui/demo.html) seems to be working well, but I've spent more time on layout and organization than content so far, so I need to catch up with the code so I can keep them in parity.
* Finish making custom attributes for the rest of the Semantic widgets.
* Figure out conventions for hooking up the Modules and Behaviors further into Aurelia. I haven't really used them enough to have a feel for what they might look like aside from calling `$( this.element ).dropdown();` from `attached()` or whatever.


## Installing

Again, this isn't production-ready yet, but once it is, this is how you'll install it.

In your Aurelia project install the plugin via `jspm` with following command

    jspm install npm:aurelia-semantic-ui

Make sure you use [manual bootstrapping](http://aurelia.io/docs#startup-and-configuration). In order to do so open your `index.html` and locate the element with the attribute aurelia-app. Change it to look like this:

    <body aurelia-app="main">

Create (if you haven't already) a file `main.js` in your `src` folder as described in the [Boostrapping Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/docs.html#/aurelia/framework/1.0.0-beta.1.1.4/doc/article/app-configuration-and-startup) section of the Aurelia documentation. Add this before you call `aurelia.start()` to install the plugin in your app:

    aurelia.use.plugin( 'aurelia-semantic-ui' );


If you wish to test to see if the plugin is being installed correctly, you can add the following markup as a sample:

    <div ui-card class="centered">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/avatar2/large/elyse.png">
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <a class="header">Elyse</a>
      </div>
    </div>
